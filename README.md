# UBER DATA ANALYSIS USING EDA

The project for Uber data analysis involves analyzing Uber's ride data to gain insights into the company's operations, customer behavior, and overall performance. The project may involve analyzing various datasets, such as trip data, driver data, user data, and revenue data, to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for optimization.

Some of the key objectives of the project may include identifying peak demand periods, analyzing driver behavior and performance, determining customer satisfaction levels, understanding the impact of pricing strategies on demand, and optimizing the allocation of drivers to meet demand.

## Lesson learnt
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in any data analysis project. Here are some key lessons that can be learned from EDA:

Data quality: EDA can reveal issues with data quality such as missing values, inconsistent data, or outliers. It's important to address these issues before proceeding with any analysis.

Data distribution: EDA helps in understanding the distribution of the data. It can help in identifying if the data is normally distributed or skewed, which can influence the choice of statistical tests.

Correlation: EDA can reveal correlations between variables. It's important to understand these correlations before proceeding with any analysis to avoid spurious relationships.

Data outliers: EDA helps in identifying outliers, which can have a significant impact on the analysis. It's important to understand the cause of these outliers and decide whether to exclude or include them in the analysis.

Data trends: EDA can reveal trends in the data over time or across different groups. It's important to understand these trends before making any conclusions about the data.


Overall, EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis project, and it's important to take the time to thoroughly explore and understand the data before proceeding with any analysis.
